# My Rainmeter Skins

These are a collection of very simple [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) [skins](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/skins/) I wrote for my personal use. 
I am releasing them here under the [CC-by-SA 4.0 license](https://github.com/s7u512/MyRainmeterSkins/blob/main/License.md).

## Usage

To use these skins, simply place the contents to your Rainmeter skins folder, which is typically located at `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Rainmeter`.
